================

The problem faced by the HOD of the Computer Applications department is called Process Synchronization problem 
in Operating System. It has following components:-

1.	Processes- here the processes are MCA 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year classes,
  	admin special exam crowd and T&P written test candidates.
2.	Resource- Only 1 resource is available which is CSE-301. All the classes wants to access it at the same time.
3.	CPU- The CPU of the given problem is the HOD, who is handling all the processes and the resources.
4.	CPU Cycle- It is the time of the HOD, that the he spends on managing all the classes.
    
    The process Synchronization is the coordination between processes which want to use a single resource at the same time. 
    
The problem here can be solved in 3 modules. These are:-

1.	Busy waiting with spin lock
2.	Using blocked (waiting) queues without busy waiting.
3.	Using monitors.

    The software presented here constitutes 3 sections:-
1.	Definition learning- As this software is a e-learning software, so the users can learn the required terms 
    and OS concepts first. This software help users to learn all the concepts used in the CSE-301 allocation problem
    beforehand only.
2.	Problem Solution- This section varies module-to-module. This section contains the code for each module to
    solve the problem.
3.	GUI representation- This section will be having the GUI presentation of the software for each module. 


How to use it?

It’s very simple. Just copy the code to some C compiler and Run it to see the definition section and problem solution 
section. 
To see the GUI representation working, just download the .ZIP file from the github repository and save it somewhere in
your system. Run the index file contained in the folder in some browser to see how it works.

 
  So, what are you waiting for!!!
    Enjoy Education, Enjoy e-learning……………….
